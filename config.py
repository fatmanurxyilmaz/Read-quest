        "the plot pilot": "You want twists! Turns! Thrills! You don’t read — you navigate. You crave high-stakes drama and juicy mysteries with every chapter keeping you guessing.",
        "the melancholic ruminator": "You're introspective, a quiet observer of life’s bittersweet complexities. You love characters who reflect, break, rebuild — and sometimes just... feel.",
        "the hopeless romantic": "You're a softie — and proud of it. You adore love stories that make your heart flutter and characters that feel like soulmates. Happy tears? Yes, please.",
        "the leering diva": "Drama? Scandal? Forbidden passion? You’re here for it. You love your fiction with flair, seduction, and a sprinkle of chaos.",
        "the workaholic": "You read like you work — with purpose. Self-growth, big ideas, and a hunger for knowledge guide your shelves. Hustle meets hardcover.",
        "the teagan": "You’re poetic, a little nostalgic, and a lover of literature’s quietest moments. The world slows down when you read — and that’s just how you like it.",
        "the history nerd": "You’re basically a time traveler with a library card. Whether it's pharaohs, philosophers, or folklore, you want to know what came before — in detail.",
        "the growth guru": "You’re here to evolve. Books are your teachers, and you’re always flipping pages on your journey toward inner peace, deeper purpose, and sharper perspective.",
        "the joyful activist": "You believe books can change the world — and you. You read with your heart and your fists, inspired by justice, humanity, and voices that demand to be heard.",
        "the jack of all trades": "You're curious about everything — and you read like it. One day it's science, the next day it's sculpture, then suddenly it's Norse mythology. You're a genre globetrotter.",
        "the literature sage": "A lover of depth, meaning, and language itself, you thrive on prose that stings, sings, and stays with you. You quote Camus in casual conversation.",
        "the geeky chap": "You’re the first to pre-order a new space opera or annotate a time travel paradox. Smart, loyal, and always one plot twist ahead.",
        "the chill guy": "Reading is your escape. You like stories that flow easily but still pack a punch. You're not high-maintenance — just highly readable.",
        "the yearner": "You want to feel something. Deep connection, big dreams, the ache of what-if — that’s your bookish bread and butter.",
        "the thriller seeker": "You chase danger from the safety of your blanket. Crime scenes, monsters, psychological chaos — nothing’s too dark or twisted for you.",
        "the deducer dudette": "You're the armchair detective of your friend group. You notice everything, love a puzzle, and crave the thrill of the final reveal."
